Prototype Link
This Project will be added to your Git Repository 

This will need a peer review

Grading will be based on how close your website is to the prototype.

Also you must make the website responsive. 
***If your assignment arrives past the due date, it is destined for a zero.***

Peer Review: The desktop version looks great and closely matches the prototype, though a bit of realignment could help refine it further. However, issues start to appear in the tablet view, and by the time it switches to mobile, the layout completely breaks. Optimizing the responsiveness for these views will make the design consistent and user-friendly across all devices.
